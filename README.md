Runs a discord bot that allow control of a game similar to twitch plays

You will have to create your own discord bot to run this code, instructions can be found here:

Be sure to also change the controls to your specifications.
NOTE: For some reason using actual letter and number keys like 'A' and 'B' aren't processed properly, 
so try to use special keys like Key.space exclusively
